The Emotion Detection System using Machine Learning project is an innovative approach to interpreting human emotions by leveraging machine learning techniques. Built primarily using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, this system integrates multi-modal data sources—audio, video, and text—to analyze and predict emotions effectively.

This was our final year project.
